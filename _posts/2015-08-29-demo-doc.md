What this is all About

So, there’s this thing called Blazewater.
Release 2.0
Change something 
**dsf**_
### It’s a piece of software to which developers, product managers and planners have devoted thousands of hours over the past couple of years. It’s going to transform the process of building accurate, actionable financial plans from hours of tinkering in Excel to the push of a button on a slick, Web-based interface. It’s going to help us bring on new clients while ensuring those with whom we now work have up-to-date, relevant advice as they pursue financial progress.
But how does it work? Why did it recommend that level of retirement savings, and in that type of account? Why does my client’s flex spending number look different now than it did before? How does it factor in my clients’ bonus? These are a few of the many questions that conscientious planners will raise as they begin using a tool that, although quick and efficient, offers less in the way of immediate insight as to its calculations.
That’s where this documentation comes in: it’s an evolving story that seeks to explain the details of Blazewater’s algorithm: that is, how and why it produces the calculations it does. It’s an unwieldy set of documents that brings you right into the weeds of the math behind the 50,000 lines of code that comprise Blazewater.
Before diving in, let’s talk about the process through which this documentation emerged, which will lead to an explanation of its purpose, its scope, and the ways in which it will change in the months and years to come.

 
In a perfect world, every client would supply impeccable data on every aspect of his or her pay-stub. In the real world, Blazewater extrapolates the client’s income situation from the information it receives.
For example, it’s common for a client to report his gross income and take-home pay but tell us nothing about how much of the difference goes to, say, taxes, insurance premiums or other expenses. Blazewater assumes the difference is comprised entirely of taxes unless contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts enter the picture: these savings form the difference between “after-tax” and “take-home” pay in Blazewater’s view.
If employer-retirement savings are absent, Blazewater views “after-tax” and “take-home” pay as identical values.
*
When Blazewater receives vague information as to the frequency of a given income, it makes an assumption along the lines that, say, a client with an after-tax income of $60,000 who receives paychecks bi-monthly receives $2,500 per paycheck.

*

There are a couple of crucial data points with which even the most diligent clients could never provide us: the dates on which their incomes will change and by how much.
For the sake of realistic projections, Blazewater assumes all “active” income – that is, earned income as opposed to investment proceeds or that received as rent - increases at a 3% inflation rate every year. This trend continues until the client retires, at which point, we expect, active income ceases. We project passive income like investment proceeds and rental income continue through the client's lifetime.
"Active" income includes only earned income; as such, it's the income we use when assessing a person's ability to contribute to various retirement accounts and the amounts they can contribute. For example, we would decline to recommend a client saves into an IRA if he or she lacks "active" - or, earned - income. 
*
If a Planner marks a given income stream “taxable” but lacks information on how much of it is withheld, Blazewater will calculate the client’s effective tax rate and apply it to this income stream. Maximum withholding for taxes on income is 30% .” Just to be clear, as this question arose when we were writing the documentation, we calculate the client's actual, effective tax rate rather than just using the closest marginal rate. 
 The “retirement_taxation” audit file displays a client’s effective tax rate. The rate is the sum of the client’s effective federal rate, a five-percent state tax “buffer,” and the 7.65% FICA rate.
 *
Blazewater distinguishes between a client’s “main” income and his or her “other” income:
For the main income stream, we assume the tax liability the client supplies (i.e., the difference between gross income and take-home pay) is correct. If they supply no tax liability, we’ll calculate their effective tax rate using a method explained below, and we’ll urge them to save that much in escrow throughout the year.
Estimating the tax liability on the client’s main income source means applying the tax liability their marginal tax rate would imply (and we assume these brackets increase with inflation, by 3% each year). In addition, we apply a “state tax buffer” of 5%, as well as  FICA taxes totaling 7.65% of gross income.
We have yet to build a way to “cap” Social Security taxes: that is, instead of projecting that only the client’s first $118,500 of income is subject to Social Security tax (which is the case in real life as of 2015), we assume that all the client’s earned income is subject to Social Security tax. On that note, we do not apply the Medicare surtax rate to even to incomes that would, in reality, trigger this tax.
*
The way we apply total taxes to the client’s income varies based on her filing status: if she files jointly with her spouse, we apply the tax liability (calculated based on the couple’s joint bracket) to the couple’s combined income. Otherwise, we apply the liability to an individual’s income. We would base their liability on their individual bracket, whether single or
